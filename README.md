# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The classic game of rock, paper, scissors played against a computer that will randomly select an option.
The game will keep track of how many wins and loses you get against the computer.
This game was a great way for me to learn how to use the Math.random function, CSS manipulation and a fun way to learn JavaScript.
